reV Parameter Batching
======================

This example set shows how reV inputs can be parameterized and the execution
can be batched.

Batching Config Description
---------------------------

 - "sets" in the batch config is a list of batches.
 - Each "batch" is a dictionary containing "args" and "files".
 - "args" are the key/value pairs from which the batching combinations will be
   made. Each unique combination of args represents a job. If two args are
   specified with three possible values each, nine jobs will be run.
 - The unique combinations of "args" will be replaced in all files in the
   "files" list. The arg must already exist in the file for the new values to
   be inserted. The replacement is done recursively.
 - Batch jobs will be assigned names based on the args. Accordingly, the name
   field specification should be omitted in all configs.

How to Run
----------

Before submitting batch jobs, it is sometimes useful to perform a "dry-run" which will create all of the batch sub directories without submitting jobs to SLURM:

.. code-block:: bash

    rev -c "../config_batch.json" batch --dry-run
    
Once you are happy with the dry-run, or if you are confident in your job setup, you can submit all batch jobs using the following CLI call:

.. code-block:: bash

    rev -c "../config_batch.json" batch

If anything goes wrong, you can cancel all batch jobs using the command:

.. code-block:: bash

    rev -c "../config_batch.json" batch --cancel
    
New sub directories will be created in the folder with the batch config file
for each sub job. All job files in the same directory (and sub directories) as
the batch config file will be copied into the job folders. The reV pipeline
manager will be executed in each sub directory. The above batch cli command
can be issues repeatedly to clean up the sub directory status ``.jsons``,
kick off the next step in the pipeline, or to rerun failed jobs. See the reV
pipeline execution example for more details on how the pipeline works.

You can also have the batch module submit pipeline monitoring background processes using the ``--monitor-background`` flag as shown below. 
Please note that the stdout/stderr of the background processes will not be captured, so it's important to set the ``log_file`` argument in the pipeline config. 

.. code-block:: bash

    rev -c "../config_batch.json" batch --monitor-background

All of the batch jobs can be collected into a single file using the multi-year
collection utility. This utility is not part of the batch pipeline and needs to
be executed and configured separately. See the ``config_multi-year.json`` file
for details on how to setup this collection step. To execute, use the following
command:

.. code-block:: bash

    rev -c "../config_multi-year.json" multi-year
